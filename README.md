These notebooks and file are for the workshop at University of Crete.

The 1st notebook describes phonon calculation in monolayer MoS2 using phonopy (https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/) and enforcing the necessary symmetry constraints with hihpive (https://hiphive.materialsmodeling.org/).

The 2nd notebook describes the calcutlation of phonons in h-BN with defect center (C$_B$N$_V$  -> Carbon substitutional doping at Boron site and Nirogen vacancy) and calculation of Huangâ€“Rhys (HR) factor and photoluminescence spectra for the defect center using Pyphotonics (https://github.com/sheriftawfikabbas/pyphotonics).  Compare the calculated results with https://doi.org/10.1039/C7NR04270A

The vasp code is used for all the DFT calculations.
